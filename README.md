This is an image annotation desktop-application written in Java using the JavaFX application platform. It allows you to create bounding box annotations using rectangular and polygonal shapes. 
Annotations can be imported and saved from/to JSON files, [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) format XML-files or [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) format TXT-files.

## Main Features
* Create rectangular and polygonal ("vertices-clicking" and "freehand-drawing" modes) bounding box annotations for objects in images
* Export and import  rectangular and polygonal bounding box annotations to and from JSON and XML files (using [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) format)
* Export and import rectangular bounding box annotations using the [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) format
* Connect your own [Torch Serve](https://pytorch.org/serve/) prediction endpoint and use bounding box predictions as annotation hints
* Format validation and error reporting when importing annotations
* Nest bounding box labels (which is then reflected in the output XML-file if using Pascal VOC format)
* Easily and swiftly navigate and search the loaded image files via a side-panel with thumbnails
* Tag bounding boxes using tags defined in the Pascal VOC format (truncated, difficult, occluded, pose: *, action: *)
* Color-coded, searchable and fully dynamic object categories

### Alternative installation methods
#### Windows ([chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/boundingboxeditor))
```
choco install boundingboxeditor
```

## How to use the application
Please refer to the [User Manual](https://github.com/mfl28/BoundingBoxEditor/wiki#user-manual) in the Wiki for a detailed usage guide and presentation (including gifs) of the application's main functions.

## Using annotations for object detection
After having created annotations for your images, you can use the saved bounding boxes as ground-truths in the training and evaluation of neural networks in order to perform object-detection tasks. How this can be done for any kind of labeled objects using Python and the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep learning library is shown exemplarily in the [Humpback Whale Fluke Detection - Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mfl28/MachineLearning/blob/master/notebooks/Humpback_Whale_Fluke_Detection.ipynb) which you can find in my [Machine Learning repo](https://github.com/mfl28/MachineLearning).

## How to build the application
The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as build-system.
You will need to have Gradle version 5+ and a Java JDK version 11+ installed on your system, e.g. from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/). 
After cloning the repository into a folder on your machine you may build the application from the root folder by opening a command line and using:
```bash
gradlew build # Add "-x test" to skip the UI-tests.
```
*Note:* The concrete way of invoking `gradlew` depends on your OS and used command line: 
* __Linux & MacOs__: `./gradlew ...`
* __Windows__:
  - Command Prompt: `gradlew ...`
  - Powershell: `.\gradlew ...`

## How to run the application
To run the app using Gradle, use:
```bash
gradlew run
```

## How to run the tests
The project comes equipped with automatic UI-tests which use [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) and the [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) testing frameworks. Due to some used functionality in the implemented tests it is (currently) not possible to run the tests in headless mode.

To run the tests, use :
```bash
gradlew test
```

## How to build the latest Linux image and installers using Docker
First build the Docker image from the cloned repo's root directory using:
```bash
docker image build -t bbeditor .
```
Then create a writable container layer over the image (without starting a container):
```bash
docker container create --name bbeditor bbeditor
```
Finally, copy the directory containing the build artifacts to the host:
```bash
docker container cp bbeditor:/artifacts .
```
> **Alternative**:  
> If you have a recent Docker version that supports BuildKit engine (version >= 19.03) you can do 
> the whole build using a one-line command:
>```bash
> DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker image build --target artifacts --output type=local,dest=. . 
>```
